# Telegram Translation Platform Shortcuts (dev)

Adds useful keyboard shortcuts and enhances your experience on Telegram's Translation Panel.

If you run out of clicking fingers, consider giving this userscript a try.
The shortcuts are aimed at anyone who uses the [Translations website](https://translations.telegram.org), as translator, contributor, or as a reviewer when applying untranslated strings.

It’s currently an early work-in-progress, but you might still find it handy. Contributions and ideas are welcome!
