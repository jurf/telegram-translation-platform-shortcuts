# Telegram Translation Platform Shortcuts

Adds useful keyboard shortcuts to the Telegram Translation Platform and enhances your experience.

If you run out of clicking fingers, consider giving this userscript a try.
The shortcuts are aimed at anyone who uses the [Translations website](https://translations.telegram.org), as translator, contributor, or as a reviewer when applying untranslated strings.

It’s currently an early work-in-progress, but you might still find it handy. Contributions and ideas are welcome!
